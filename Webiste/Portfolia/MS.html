        My name is Emon Khan. I am 14 years old, and I live in Gazipur, Bangladesh. I study at Vartex Academy School and College, which is a place that has given me many opportunities to learn, grow, and dream big. I am in my early teenage years, and like many students my age, I am trying to figure out what I really love to do, what I want to become, and how I can prepare myself to achieve my dreams.

        One thing I know for sure is that I want to become a programmer. This dream did not come to me suddenly — it has grown inside me over time. I have always been fascinated by computers, gadgets, and technology in general. From a young age, I was curious about how games work, how websites are made, how servers keep running, and how so many people can play games together online. I love video games — playing them is my favorite hobby. But instead of just playing, I often find myself wondering about the code behind the game. I want to know how every block, character, or world is created, how commands work, and how players from different parts of the world connect to one server and share the same experience.
      </p>

        This curiosity led me to run my own Minecraft server, which I named WATERMC. Running a server is not as simple as just turning it on. I have to configure plugins, manage players, fix bugs, and make sure everything works smoothly. I have used plugins like TAB to customize my server’s scoreboard and tablist. I enjoy setting up custom headers, footers, and making sure players see their names, ranks, balances, and the number of players online. Doing these things makes me feel like I am not just playing a game but building something that others can enjoy too. It is a small taste of what real programming can do — solving problems, creating new things, and sharing them with others.

        I have also explored other technical areas to support my server and my growing interest in coding. For example, I learned how to install Linux Mint and Ubuntu as portable operating systems on a USB drive using VMware. This means I can carry my own customized Linux system anywhere I go. I even installed Ubuntu WSL on my Windows machine so I can run Linux commands directly on my computer. Learning to change download mirrors to a local one in Bangladesh showed me how important it is to optimize systems for speed and efficiency.

        I have also tried connecting my server to Cloudflare to add extra security and privacy. I figured out how to create a tunnel so that I can access my home server using SSH securely from anywhere. I experimented with VNC servers, which let me remotely control another computer’s desktop. I have checked CPU temperatures, monitored Apache2 server traffic using Netdata, and fixed problems when my MySQL or MariaDB databases would not start. I have typed commands, read logs, debugged errors, and slowly learned that problem-solving is at the heart of programming and system administration.
      </p>

        Besides all the technical stuff, I care a lot about my studies too. I believe that a good programmer should also be good at other subjects because knowledge connects everything. My favorite subject in school is English. I like how words can be used creatively to explain thoughts, write essays, and tell stories. English also helps me understand programming languages better because they are all based on instructions written in English words and symbols. When I study English, I feel like I am sharpening my thinking skills.

        Math is another important subject for me, even though it sometimes feels challenging. Before my math exams, I look for the fastest ways to revise. I ask for tips on using my calculator properly, solving tricky problems, and understanding concepts like the least common multiple (LCM). I like to solve problems step by step but also look for smart shortcuts. I know that math is the language of computers too — algorithms, logic gates, and coding structures are all based on math. So, I try my best to get better at it.

    <div class="paragraph-card">

        I practice my writing skills by asking for help with paragraphs and letters. I have written about many topics, like the value of time, the role of newspapers in our daily lives, and how I spent my summer vacation. Writing these pieces helps me prepare for exams and improves my confidence in expressing myself. Sometimes I ask for short paragraphs; other times I try longer ones so I can challenge myself.
      </p>

        My curiosity goes beyond schoolwork and technology. I often think deeply about the world and my place in it. For example, I once asked about the difference between Sunni and Shia Muslims because I wanted to understand the diversity within my faith. I asked if the S&P 500 is halal because I wondered how investing works in Islam. I believe that knowing about these things makes me more responsible and aware of how the world works and how my religion guides my choices.

        I am someone who likes to experiment. When I build a website, I want to know how to make it better — how to add a meta description to improve SEO, how to optimize performance and security, and how to add download links for files like PDFs. When I get stuck, I ask for help and learn from my mistakes. If my Apache2 server has problems, I check logs, restart services, or look for solutions. If I want to monitor traffic, I explore tools like Netdata, even if it takes time to understand all the settings.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-card">

        Sometimes, my experiments fail. Maybe a plugin does not work as expected, a command gives an error, or a configuration breaks something. But I do not give up. I try again. I search for answers, read documentation, and learn from my mistakes. This patience and perseverance make me feel more like a real programmer every day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-card">
      <p>
        When I am not studying, configuring servers, or playing games, I spend time thinking about the future. I imagine myself studying Computer Science at a good university. I dream about learning advanced programming languages like Python, Java, or C++. I want to build apps, websites, or maybe even my own game someday. I want to work with other talented people who share my passion for technology.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-card">
      <p>
        I also want to give back to my community. I know that many kids in my area might not have access to good computers or fast internet. If I become a good programmer and earn well, I want to teach coding to young students for free. I want to open a small computer lab where children can learn to code, play educational games, and discover the world of technology.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-card">
      <p>
        I believe that technology can solve many problems if we use it wisely. It can help people communicate, run businesses, learn new skills, and even protect the environment. As a programmer, I want to create solutions that make life better for others. Maybe I will build a tool that helps students manage their homework better or an app that helps parents track their children’s studies. Maybe I will build a secure server that hosts websites for local businesses.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph-card">
      <p>
        Apart from coding and technology, I know I need to stay grounded and balanced. I try to be respectful to my teachers, kind to my friends, and helpful at home. My family supports my dreams, and I want to make them proud. I remind myself to take breaks, get enough sleep, and stay healthy.

        To sum up everything about myself: I am Emon Khan — a young boy with a big dream, a curious mind, and a passion for learning and creating. I love my games, my servers, my coding adventures, and my school subjects. I love to ask questions, find answers, fix problems, and help others. I believe that one day I will become a skilled programmer who uses technology to make a positive difference in the world. And until that day comes, I will keep learning, trying, failing, fixing, and dreaming bigger every single day.
